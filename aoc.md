[Advent of Code|git@github.com:jamesfisher314/AdventOfCode.git] in all its embarrasing glory. To think - I do this professionally!

Splitting the numbers by max_delta eliminated most valid combinations.
Solved like Fibonacci in O(N); summed relevant past values at each increasing value.
TODO: analyze the difference between splitting and summing priors

Is this a modified game of life?
Regardless, I clearly wrote a bug in my implementation.

One catches bugs with more tests; I'll confirm each expected action occurs on the example input.

Okay. An && needed to be an ||. That still doesn't fix everything - all seat fills are also seat empties in round 2. -.-

Day 4? Clearly shifting my sleep schedule 5 hours earlier is causing jet lag. It doesn't even seem to be a hard problem. Do I need to use object orientation?

Day 5. List comprehensions rather than OO. I've got like 10 articles open about Python memory management to read this weekend.

I can count; see revised comments.
Technically my goal is a year of git commits; this commit achieves that goal.
However, I'm going to look at and think about the problem from the 12th day of Advent. No promises that it'll be longer than 3 minutes.
