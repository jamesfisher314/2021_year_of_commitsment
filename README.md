@jamesfisher314

# What
One git commit, however useless the commit is

# When
Every day in Pacific Time

# Where
Usually my desk, but I hope to code in the woods

# Why
- I would like 2021 to include more growth than 2020.
- Some commits will be adjacent to interview problems. I'd like to be ready to act on inspiring opportunities.
- Some commits will improve personal projects. I want to develop an Android app for myself.
- Why not?
